### Project Description:
We plan to implement a foggy thriller escape game with randomly generated trees and terrains. Our game starts with placing the player at a random position in our scene and the goal of the player is to find the exit of our tree maze. As player moves around the terrain, the trees surrounding him will be randomly generated and the player will see shadow mapped to the fog's particles. If the player successfully reach the exit, we remove the fog and switch the whole scene to Toon Shading. Lastly replace the thriller music with a cheerful one.

### Technical Points:

#### Easy
1. Toon Shading
2. Particle Effect
3. First person camera
4. Selection Buffer
5. Collision detection with bounding spheres or boxes

#### Medium
1. Procedurally generated Terrain
2. Procedurally generated plants with L-systems
3. Shadow mapping

### What's Creative:
We believe that the most creative part of the game would be the drastic contrast from thriller to cartoon at the end of the game which hopefully would give us an surprisingly entertaining effect.

### Sketching:
